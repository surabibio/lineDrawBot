# lineDrawBot
A line drawing semi automatic tool for tennis courts.

### Problem:
Drawing lines in clay courts is a daily and time consuming job. A semi-automatic tool will ease the workload for the field worker.

### Current Art:
White cement powder is emuslisified in water and applied with a brush. The emusifing utensil and the brush has to be cleaned and kept dry every day to prevent setting of white cement.
### Idea:
 
In this automatic tool emulsification should be done is such a way that there needs to be no maintainance or cleaning at all.
 After days of brain-stroming, I finally settled that mixing of water and cement should happen outside the device if it has to be maintance free. 
 Hence instead of solid in water emulsion, we will have
 
1. Solid-air mixture. A device that gives a low flow rate, solid rich gaseous mixture. I prefere a low flow rate that will not pollute the air around even to the slightest extent. A cyclotron type of mixer will be used.
 
2. A water-air aerosol is then sprayed on the deposited powder on the ground to set it. 
  
  To preempt any patent suits, I am documenting this idea as open source to be used by one and all.
  
  The product relisation has started and I strive to complete it ASAP using external help as much as possible.
  I also intend to commercialise this product at a modest profit and make an enterprise out of this idea.
